## Project Scenario
A small cinema business called "**Lunardo Cinemas**" (referred to hereafter as the client) is located in a medium sized country town and has asked you to develop their **website to promote its business, to take online bookings**.

The Lunardo Cinema knows that it cannot compete with the major chains (Village, Hoyts) which are located some distance away in larger towns and has relied too long on the loyalty and laziness of locals for business. A few months ago, the client decided to close for renovations, upgrade their cinema seating, and install new 3D projection facilities, new Dolby lighting and sound.

The client expects to have a grand reopening in a few months’ time (ie around **12 weeks**) and would like a new website ready to launch the new cinema.
